# 6502-assembly
A collection of micro-projects developed while studying 6502 Assembly for the Atari 2600, culminating in a simple yet complete bomber game.

These projects make use of the [DASM assembler](https://dasm-assembler.github.io/) and the [Stella Atari 2600 emulator](https://stella-emu.github.io/), as well as [companion header files](https://github.com/munsie/dasm/tree/master/machines/atari2600) provided by [munsie](https://github.com/munsie).

The [Gopher2600 emulator](https://github.com/JetSetIlly/Gopher2600) was also used for its debugging tools, and [6502.org](http://www.6502.org/tutorials/6502opcodes.html) proved a useful tool for understanding clockcycles and opcodes.
